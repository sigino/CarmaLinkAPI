<h2>Buzzer configuration</h2>  
The buzzer is a real-time, in-car audible signal generated by the transponder in response to event conditions, and can be a useful feedback mechanism to inform a driver of unwanted behavior. Each report has its own buzzer pattern (see table below), and allowed values for the buzzer configuration are high, medium or off. Audible alerts in-car may present a distraction and Carma is not liable for an incorrect buzzer volume selection.

> When the buzzer configuration is updated, the configId does not change as the nature of the information sent back in the report is unaffected.
