## Report data structure  
All configurable reports produce Report Data objects in JSON format that contain the following standard fields:  

Field | JSON Name | Value type | Units | Notes
------|-----------|------------|-------|-------
Serial Number | serial | Integer | - | Identifies the transponder's serial number.  
Configuration ID | configId | Integer | - | References the specific configuration that caused this report to be generated.  
Event start timestamp	| eventStart | Integer | milliseconds | The POSIX time when the report's event first became true (after any allowance).  
Report timestamp | reportTimestamp | Integer | milliseconds | The POSIX time when the report was generated: all parameter values in the report are in reference to this value.  
Duration | duration | Integer | milliseconds | The Report timestamp minus the event start timestamp; the amount of time the event has been true.    
In progress | inProgress | Boolean | true or false | Identifies whether the event is true or false at the time indicated by the reportTimestamp.  

This information will always be in all configurable reports.  

In its most basic form, a report will simply tell you when the event (as defined by the report's configuration) became true and whether the event is still true at the time the report was generated (reportTimestamp).  

### Parametric data  
The remainder of the report contains various standard and configurable parameter values, all of which were sampled at the time indicated by the reportTimestamp.  

For each parameter mentioned in this section a data field **will only be included in the report if the information is available at the time the report is generated** (reportTimestamp).  

### Configurable parameter data  
Recall that a report's configuration identifies which optional data to add to the report. This section specifies the format of this data within the Report Data object.  


### Location Object  
The Location object provides a kinematic snapshot of your vehicle in time and space. It provides the following fields:  

Field | JSON Name | Value type | Notes  
------|-----------|------------|-------
Longitude | longitude | Double | Degrees  
Latitude | latitude | Double | Degrees  
Accuracy | accuracy | Float | Meters, in reference to the longitude/latitude  
Heading |	heading	| Float |	Degrees, where 0째 is north, 90째 is east, 180째 is south, and 270째 is west
Speed | speed	| Float | km/hour  
Timestamp | gpsTimestamp | Integer | Specifies the POSIX time in milliseconds when location data was captured: this will likely be older than the report timestamp!  

If you set 'location' in your report configuration to 'true', then the transponder will try to include location information in your report. This information will be null (missing) in all reports until the transponder acquires a GPS lock.  

**GPS Timestamp**  
One special quality of the location object is that it includes its own timestamp. The transponder will update its location information as quickly as possible, and under favorable operating conditions that means that the `'gpsTimestamp'` should be approximately equal to the `'reportTimestamp'`. However, sometimes GPS lock can be lost, for example, when you enter a structure (tunnel, parking garage, etc). In this case, the transponder will always provide the **last known** location in the report data object: the freshness of this data will be indicated by the difference in time between the reportTimestamp and gpsTimestamp. Therefore, when examining report data it is important to see how recent the location information is with respect to the report timestamp.  

### Optional Parameters Data Object  
The Optional Parameters Data object includes any parameters specified in the report's configuration, and could include:  


Field | JSON Name | Value type | Units | Notes
------|-----------|------------|-------|-------
Battery voltage | batteryVoltage | Float | Volts | Typically accurate to within 50mV.
Emission monitors | emissionMonitors | Integer | - | This is the bit-encoded value returned by an OBD-II (SAE J1979) Mode 1, PID 1 request that indicates which emission monitors are supported and which are incomplete.
Fuel level | fuelLevel | Float | % | Reported as a decimal (0.5 = 50%)
Fuel rate | fuelRate | Float | liters/hour | Engine configuration should be set to ensure this value is as accurate as possible.
Distance to service | distanceToService | Integer | km | When available, it is accurate to the nearest ten kilometers.
Duration to service | durationToService | Integer | Milliseconds | When available, it is accurate to the nearest day (86400000 ms).
Odometer | odometer | Float | km | Accuracy is typically +/- 10km when available.
Is low battery voltage | isLowBatteryVoltage | Boolean | true or false | Indicates that the battery voltage is low enough where starting the engine might soon become difficult.
Is low tire pressure | isLowTirePressure | Boolean | true or false | This will correspond to a 'low tire pressure' warning light being illuminated on the dash.

As indicated in the report configuration section, values for these parameters will only be included in the Optional Parameters Data object if the deployment (vehicle) supports them. Many of these parameters are not 'standard' OBD-II data, and so it is possible that for your make/model of vehicle, this data will not be available. If this is the case, these fields will simply not be included in the Optional Parameters object.  

Unlike the Location object, all values in the Optional Parameters Data object are collected within a second or two of the reportTimestamp time.

### Non-configurable parameter data  
In addition to the optional/configurable data, the following fields will be included in all reports when available:  

Field | JSON name | Value type | Units | Description  
------|-----------|------------|-------|------------  
Cellular signal strength | cellSignalStrength | Float | dBm | Received signal strength indication (RSSI) for the local cellular network.  

Each type of report includes additional fields as standard, as will be described in the next section.
