<h2>2. Configuration</h2>  
A new CarmaLink is a bit of a blank slate: by default it only has one hard-coded report that it will generate when it is installed (the 'New Deployment' report). It's up to the API user to create a configuration for each type of event CarmaLink should be reporting on and/or activating its buzzer for.  

Once CarmaLink receives a configuration from the server it is stored in non-volatile memory so that this information is not lost between reset or power cycles.
