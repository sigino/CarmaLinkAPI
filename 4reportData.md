## 4. Report data  
Like report configurations, report data is retrieved on a unique URI for each serial number and each type of report.  

> :information_source:  
> 
> All report data URIs are relative to `/data`  
> 
> All report data, including the timestamps, is generated by the transponder: the server does not add any other information to these reports
