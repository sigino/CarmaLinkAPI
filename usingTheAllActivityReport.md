<h2>Using the "All Activity" Report</h2>  
When polling for data on a group of CarmaLinks it seems like it would be advantageous to use the all_activity endpoint. The all_activity endpoint should be seen as a way to gather a general snapshot of a CarmaLink's activity during a designated timespan. It's important to keep in mind that since this endpoint only returns 50 data items per sub-report, you may need to further query each individual report to gather all of the data reported for that time period.  
  
**! The "All Activity" data report only provides 50 data records (maximum) per sub-report in the time period queried.**
